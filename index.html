              <p class="white"> At Pacific American School (PAS), one of our main goals is to ensure that we preserve the environment by maintaining the sustainability of our resources and environment. To help solve the issue of recycling, we decided to do research on the topic and create a project. One of the main issues that we noticed is the failure to recycle waste products that need to be recycled. After doing a survey, we realized that one of the main reasons why some students do not recycle is because there is no recycling bin or because it is not convenient for them to recycle something. To solve this problem, we created a game and a special recycling bin to give students an incentive to recycle.</p>

              <p class="white">We hope that we will be able to communicate important facts to our users by hooking them in with an attractive game. Ideally, this game would encourage students to play it and hopefully, the interesting yet impactful facts that we provide will persuade the students to change their ways and to recycle.

                <h2 class="whitetitle">Goals</h2>
                <p class="white">Our main goal is to educate people about recycling. Our survey allowed us to conclude that many students aren’t aware of the importance of recycling. According to the survey, the main reason for not recycling is because there isn’t an available recycling bin, causing the student to throw away a recyclable item in a trash can or perhaps even litter. We believe that through education, students will understand the true importance of recycling and take the extra step to recycle each time, instead of trashing an item or littering.</p>
                <p class="white"></p>
                <p class="white">Although recycling is very important, there are many misconceptions about it like what objects can or can’t be recycled. This is especially true in Taiwan since there are often many different categories of recyclable bins, there could be lots of confusion surrounding recycling. Through our project, we want to make it clear what objects belong in which category as well as what objects can and can’t be recycled.
                </p>
                <p class="white"></p>
                <p class="white">Some people do not understand the severity of not recycling. Therefore, they could throw trash in a recycling bin or a recyclable item in a trash can for the sake of convenience. We want to educate people about the consequences of not recycling properly by giving specific impacts that not recycling or recycling could cause. For example, one of our facts is “Did you know that for every ton of recycled cardboard, 9 cubic yards are saved in landfills?”

            <div class="pad"></div>
            <h2 class="whitetitle">Our Idea</h2>
            <p class="white"></p>
            <p class="white">Our first idea consists of a mobile game and a special recycling bin. The basic concept is to encourage the user to recycle in our designated bins by giving them in-game rewards. The recycling bin would have a sensor and a QR code that the user would scan to register the points in their games. There would also have been a hatch in the bin that opens and closes based on the status of the user, which is determined by the app. Additionally, a sensor would be used in the bin in order to verify that the object thrown in the bin is a recyclable object and whether or not a user should gain points.
            </p>
            <p class="white"></p>
            <p class="white">We realized that this idea isn’t feasible for two main reasons. The main reason is that this system is easily exploitable and hard to prevent cheating. Users could effortlessly scan the QR code multiple times or set off the sensor with another object multiple times. Both of these examples would result in the user gaining numerous amount of points without actually recycling. Secondly, none of our team members have experience with motor control. After doing some research, we realized that in order to control the hatch of the bin, we would need to connect and modify the motor to make it compatible with an Arduino chip. None of us have experience with this, and we also decided that we didn’t have enough time to learn and assemble the motor.
            </p>
            <p class="white"></p>
            <p class="white">Subsequently, we moved on to our second idea. This idea focuses on the game itself, instead of having a recycling bin to accompany it. The idea is to create a game where users will learn facts about recycling through gameplay. For every level that the user completes, there will be a popup that contains a fact about recycling or sustainability. These facts are carefully selected to have a balance between being impactful, educational, and interesting. At first glance, the idea may seem to ruin the immersion of the game, but we are coming up with new ideas as to how to integrate the facts into the game in a more fitting way.
